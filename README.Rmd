# Readme:

This repository is made for returning my final exercise on a open data science course. Here is a [link](https://github.com/MSatHY/IODS-final.git) to my final excercise web page (my aim in the exercise is to study Finnish muncipalities). The repository and the web page are hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
